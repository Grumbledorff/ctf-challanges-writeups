title:Breaking Out of Yankin
point:100
One Piece is Real! Brave explorers, your mission begins here. The One Piece, the legendary treasure, lies hidden in the vast universe, and only those with the sharpest reverse engineering skills and unbreakable determination can claim it. In this 24-hour journey, you will face countless trials, but remember: You are warriors, dreamers, and conquerors of the impossible! The Force is strong within you, and with each step, you get closer to the treasure that will bring you eternal glory. But first, a great challenge stands before you.

We are currently trapped at Yakin, the mighty gas giant swirling in the endless void, controlled by the ruthless Palpatine. This villain has set traps and obstacles for us, determined to keep us from achieving our goal. But we will not falter, for we are explorers, and no force in this galaxy or beyond can stop us from reaching the One Piece!

To continue, you must prove yourself worthy. This is your first task—to Break Out of Yakin (BOY). But escaping the villain's clutches requires more than just brute force. You must find the password that will let the machine decide if you are a "Good BOY" and ready to continue your journey.

Warrior’s Code: To submit the flag, you must follow the warrior’s tradition. If the password you discover is not already in the form EnXp{...flag...}, then submit it in this format: EnXp{flag}

For example, if the password that deems you a Good BOY is WillOfD, then you should submit it as: EnXp{WillOfD}

However, if the password is already in the correct format, such as EnXp{WillOfD}, simply submit it as is.

May the Force guide your steps, and remember, explorers: The One Piece is real, but only for those who prove themselves worthy of this epic journey.

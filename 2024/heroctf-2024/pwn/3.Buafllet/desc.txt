You have one bullet, use it wisely...

You will have two exposed ports, one for SSH and one for the challenge (TCP).
The exploit/ folder in the SSH is shared with the QEMU inside the challenge, so you can upload your exploits more easily.
- SSH credentials: player:heroctf - Use netcat for QEMU
Format : Hero{flag}

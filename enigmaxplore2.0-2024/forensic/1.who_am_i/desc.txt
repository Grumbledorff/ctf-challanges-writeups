Welcome to digital forensics!

TLDR: Get the flag!

If you're new to forensics, don't worry—it's like a digital treasure hunt where the clues are hidden in files, network traffic, or even memory dumps. Your job? Dig through the data, connect the dots, and figure out what’s really going on. Think of it as part detective work, part data ninja skills. So grab your magnifying glass (+ other forensics tools) and get ready to uncover the secrets hiding in plain sight (or not)!

Edit: File contains Red Herrings (Fake flags)
